Lost in the shadows, I'm searching for a way, But hope keeps slipping, it's a brand new gray. Oh, this world is heavy, a burden on my chest, I'm feeling broken, I must confess. But I'll keep fighting, I won't let go, In the darkest hours, I'll find my glow. The stars are hiding, can't see them shine, In this lonely hour, I'm yearning for a sign. Dreams shattered like glass, it's hard to breathe, But I'll keep pushing, I won't let grief. Through the tears and sorrow, I'll find my way, In the depths of despair, I'll see the day. Though the road is rocky, I'll walk the mile, With a heavy heart, I'll find my smile. Oh, this world is heavy, a burden on my chest, I'm feeling broken, I must confess. But I'll keep fighting, I won't let go, In the darkest hours, I'll find my glow.\"\n}"
