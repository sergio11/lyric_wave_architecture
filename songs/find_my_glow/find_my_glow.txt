Title: "Find My Glow"

The rain keeps falling, it's a never-ending night,
But I'll keep fighting, I won't lose the fight.
Though the world is heavy, a burden on my chest,
In the darkest hours, I'll find my glow.

Through tears and sorrow, I'll find my way,
In the depths of despair, I'll greet the day.
With a heavy heart, I'll keep pushing ahead,
In the darkest hours, I'll find my glow.
