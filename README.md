## Technologies Used

- **Suno-AI Bark 🐶:** [Suno-AI Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) is a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by Suno. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio, including music, background noise, and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing, and crying. These pretrained model checkpoints are available for commercial use.
- **MusicGen from AudioCraft 🎵:** [MusicGen](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) is a simple and controllable model for music generation provided by AudioCraft. It is a single-stage auto-regressive Transformer model trained over a 32 kHz EnCodec tokenizer with 4 codebooks sampled at 50 Hz. Unlike existing methods, MusicGen doesn't require self-supervised semantic representation, and it generates all 4 codebooks in one pass. It uses 20,000 hours of licensed music for training, including an internal dataset of 10,000 high-quality music tracks as well as ShutterStock and Pond5 music data.
- **Stable Diffusion Model 🖼️:** [The Stable Diffusion Model](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photorealistic images from any text input. It's based on diffusion technology and is capable of producing stunning visual representations based on text.
- **Elasticsearch 🔍:** [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/es/elasticsearch) is a powerful search and analytics engine. LyricWave uses Elasticsearch to index and search the text of songs efficiently, offering advanced search capabilities, even for simple search terms.
- **Apache Airflow 🛠️:** [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an extensible platform for orchestrating complex workflows. In the context of LyricWave, it's used to schedule and manage the music generation process.
- **Flask 📡:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) is a lightweight web framework used to build the API that allows users to initiate and manage music generation tasks in LyricWave.
- **MongoDB 📊:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es) is a versatile NoSQL database used to store and retrieve information about generated songs, including melodies, synthetic voices, abstract images, and metadata.
- **MinIO 🗄️:** [MinIO](https://min.io/) is an open-source object storage server used to store generated files, such as images and audio files.
- **HAProxy 🔄:** [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) is a load balancer responsible for managing traffic between various components of LyricWave.
- **Redis 📦:** [Redis](https://redis.io/) is an in-memory database used to store temporary data and facilitate communication between LyricWave services.

## Architecture Overview

In the LyricWave music generation platform, various architectural components work in harmony to deliver a seamless and powerful experience for both creators and music enthusiasts. Let's explore the purpose and role of each element:

<img width="auto" src="./doc/architecture_diagram.drawio.svg" />

- **Apache Airflow:** Apache Airflow serves as the orchestrator of the entire music generation process. It schedules, monitors, and manages the execution of complex workflows represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Airflow ensures that all the tasks, from generating melodies to creating final songs, are executed efficiently and in the desired sequence.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing comprehensive song details, including metadata, lyrics, generated melodies, and more. It plays a central role in data management, enabling seamless storage, retrieval, and updates throughout the music creation process.
- **HaProxy:** HaProxy serves as a load balancer, distributing incoming requests to the nodes of the Song Generation API and the Streaming API. This ensures optimal resource utilization and load distribution for the various tasks involved in music generation.
- **Celery:** Celery is the distributed task queue system responsible for executing the computationally intensive tasks involved in generating music. It efficiently parallelizes the workload and utilizes multiple worker nodes to enhance processing speed and scalability.
- **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch is used to enhance the search capabilities within the platform. It indexes the content of songs, allowing users to perform advanced searches based on specific terms. This improves the discoverability of songs and enhances the overall user experience.
- **Song Generation API in Flask (Multiplexed):** The Song Generation API, powered by Flask, offers a convenient way to manage songs. Users can create new songs, initiate the execution of Airflow DAGs, delete songs, list existing songs, and perform searches using the Elasticsearch index. It serves as the gateway for users to interact with the LyricWave platform.
- **Streaming API in Flask:** The Streaming API in Flask enables users to stream and play the generated melodies, voice files, and final songs. This real-time audio streaming feature allows listeners to experience the music as it is being generated, enhancing engagement and entertainment.
- **MinIO:** MinIO is utilized as a high-performance object storage system for the platform. It is responsible for storing various files, including generated audio and images, and provides secure and efficient access to these resources.

Together, these architectural components create a dynamic and integrated ecosystem that powers LyricWave, transforming words into beautiful melodies and immersive music experiences. Whether you're a creator or a listener, this architecture ensures that the magic of AI-powered music generation is at your fingertips.

## Tools screenshots

In this section some details of the components that make the project possible will be shown and explained.

### Apache Ariflow

You can access the web tool provided by Apache Airflow to check the execution status of the DAG and perform some administrative tasks.

![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_15.PNG)
![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_16.PNG)
![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_17.PNG)

### PostgreSQL PGAdmin

To access at a low level and review the database and carry out backups and more advanced modifications, a PGAdmin has been enabled that allows managing the PostgreSQL server on which Apache Airflow is based to centralize and persist DAG information and their executions.

![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_19.PNG)

### Celery Flower

Celery Flower is a web-based tool designed for monitoring and managing tasks in a Celery task queue. Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly, visual interface to keep track of task statuses, worker activity, and real-time statistics. Flower enables you to efficiently oversee and control Celery tasks, ensuring smooth operation in your Python applications.

![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_13.PNG)
![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_14.PNG)

### MongDB

A collection has been configured to record in detail all the logs generated during the execution of the DAG, in this way it is possible to identify errors or bad behavior later, given that the logs in Apache Airflow are difficult to check.

![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_3.PNG)

### HAProxy

It is possible to monitor the status of the replicas of the different services, each HAproxy in charge of managing each group of replicas provides a web interface to consult their status, as can be seen in the following screenshots.

### Docker Compose

The entire deployment of the project architecture has been unified in a single Docker Compose configuration

![platform picture](screenshots/screenshot_12.PNG)

## Postman Collections

Two Postman collections have been configured, to show how it is possible to easily interact with the platform, there is an API that manages the creation, deletion and query operations of songs and the other API is intended for streaming melodies, voices and songs.
